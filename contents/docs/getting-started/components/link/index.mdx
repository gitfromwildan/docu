In DocuBook, all links written in Markdown are automatically converted to their respective Next.js components. This allows for better optimization and performance in your application.

## Links

When you create a link in your Markdown, it is converted to the Next.js `Link` component. This enables client-side navigation and improves loading times. Hereâ€™s an example of how a Markdown link is transformed:

### Markdown

```markdown
[Visit OpenAI](https://www.openai.com)
```

### Rendered Output

The above Markdown is converted to:

```jsx
<Link href="https://www.openai.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  Visit OpenAI
</Link>
```

## Benefits

- **Performance Optimization**: Automatic conversion to Next.js components ensures optimized loading of links.
- **Improved User Experience**: Client-side navigation with Next.js `Link` improves the browsing experience.

By utilizing these features, you can ensure that your documentation is not only visually appealing but also performs efficiently.
