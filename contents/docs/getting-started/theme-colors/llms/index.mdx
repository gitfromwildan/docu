## Introduction
This document explains how to create and implement custom color themes using AI with LLMS context. The context includes a consistent color palette for both light and dark modes, along with syntax highlighting colors for code.

## Generate New Theme

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Step 1: Access LLM for Color Generation">
    Ensure you have access to a language model (LLM) that supports color palette generation
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Step 2: Prepare Color Context">
    Share the content of the [llms.txt](/llms.txt) file with the AI to provide the current color scheme context.
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Step 3: Define Color Requirements">
    Determine your preferred color scheme or theme requirements
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Step 4: Generate New Theme">
    Use the following prompt to request a new theme from the AI:

    ```markdown
    Create a new color theme based on the provided context with the following requirements:
    1. Different primary color `#2281E3` - changes to your brand color
    2. Maintain good contrast for accessibility
    3. Include variants for both light and dark modes
    4. Keep the same structure as the provided context
    ```
  </StepperItem>
</Stepper>

## Implementation
After receiving the new color palette:

1. Copy the generated CSS code to your theme file
2. Update CSS variables in `globals.css`
3. Adjust syntax colors in `syntax.css` if needed
4. Test the theme across different devices and display modes

## Example Implementation
```css
:root {
  --primary: 210 81% 56%;  /* Primary color */
  --secondary: 210 30% 90%;  /* Secondary color */
  /* ... and so on */
}

.dark {
  --primary: 210 100% 65%;  /* Dark mode primary color */
  /* ... and so on */
}
```

## Tips and Recommendations
- Always test color contrast to ensure accessibility
- Maintain consistency with existing themes
- Use tools like [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to verify contrast ratios
- Keep backups of previous theme versions before making major changes

## Troubleshooting
- If colors don't change, ensure CSS variables are properly imported
- Check CSS selector specificity if styles conflict
- Verify dark/light mode toggling is working correctly
