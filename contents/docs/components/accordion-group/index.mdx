An accordion is like a button that opens and closes information. To avoid clutter, long information can be hidden first and then revealed when clicked.

<Note type="note" title="Note">
  Group related accordions together using `<AccordionGroup>`. This creates a cohesive section of accordions that can be individually expanded or collapsed.
</Note>
