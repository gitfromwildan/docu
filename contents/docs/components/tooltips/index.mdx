I have implemented the `tooltips` component into markdown which allows you to add additional information to a word or phrase when hovering. This feature is useful for providing definitions, explanations, or any other additional information that can enhance the user experience.

## Usage
You can use tooltips in your Markdown content to provide additional information when hovering over a word or phrase.

### Preview

What do you know about <Tooltip text="DocuBook" tip="npx @docubook/create@latest" /> ? Create interactive nested documentations using MDX.

### Output Markdown

The above Markdown is converted to:

```markdown:index.mdx
What do you know about <Tooltip text="DocuBook" tip="npx @docubook/create@latest" /> ? Create interactive nested documentations using MDX.
```
